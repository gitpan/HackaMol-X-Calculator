DESCRIPTION
============

Abstract calculator class for HackaMol. The HackaMol::X::Calculator extension generalizes molecular calculations using external programs. The Calculator class consumes roles provided by the HackaMol core that manages the running of executables... perhaps on files; perhaps in directories.  This extension is intended to provide a simple example of interfaces with external programs.  It is probably a little too flexible. New extensions can evolve from this starting point, in scripts, to more rigid encapsulated classes.
